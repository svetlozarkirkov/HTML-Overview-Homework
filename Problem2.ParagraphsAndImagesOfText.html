        <p><b>A U.S. Coast Guard cutter is on its way to try to free an
            Australian fishing boat trapped in a block of ice 900 miles northeast Antarctica.
        </b></p>
        <p><i>The Polar Star, a Coast Guard cutter was en route to its home port in Seattle<br>
        when it was contacted by the Rescue Coordination Center in New Zealand<br>
        about the fate of the Antarctic Chieftain from Australia, and its 27 crew members,<br>
        after that vessel lost the ability to maneuver
        following damage to three of its four propellers on Tuesday.

        <p><b>FIH Erhvervsbank, a small bank in Denmark, will charge customers 0.5% interest on their deposits from March.
            Local media say 25,000 people will be affected.</b></p>
        <p><i>That means for every $100 they deposit, the bank will take 50 cents.<br>
            It says it has no choice because it is being similarly charged by the central bank,<br>
            which has cut official interest rates deep into negative territory.<br>
            The latest move by the Danish National Bank earlier this month took rates to a record low of minus 0.75%.</i></p>
